a/ Topbar or TopNavbar is looking very good and awseome but,
- get started button not required
- Instead of services and there 3 lists in dropdown, give 3 sepereate dropdown list item and for that seperate list of items inside each dropdowns with some categories names. (Instead of services -> Data annotation, Recruitment, IT support).

b/ Hero corrosal are not matching, look how cool simple, scroll icons + below dot/small rectangle swipe is looking but see how our is looking big circles and there are tomuch scroll visiblites not required at all, one horizontal two verticals. Just one horizontal visible exactly like phonepe is enough.

c/ Next section we have both circle/phill and cards, we need just one which is card and that too we need image and header/name make little bit bold size low, because too over typography's we have.

d/ the below section - All Services
This is cool, but Give our contents, data annotation, recruitment, it service and what is happening is its moving fastly, not required let the scroll feature be available for that or else we have something like it will be moving slowly, when mouse or cursor points there it will stop then again if we move cursor from that position it will again start moving, let it be like that.
