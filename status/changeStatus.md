# Current Status - Phase 9 Implementation

## Phase 9 ‚Äî Post-Implementation Refinements (Based on changesRequired.md)

### Current Issues Identified
Based on the updated requirements and image comparisons with PhonePe:

**a/ Topbar/Navbar Issues:**
- "Get Started" button not required
- Services dropdown needs restructuring: 3 separate dropdown items instead of single "Services" dropdown
- Each dropdown should have individual category lists (Data Annotation, Recruitment, IT Services)

**b/ Hero Carousel Issues:**
- Current carousel doesn't match PhonePe's simple, clean design
- Too many scroll indicators (horizontal + vertical) - only horizontal needed
- Big circles instead of simple dots/small rectangles
- Need PhonePe-style scroll icons and navigation

**c/ Service Cards Issues:**
- Mix of circle/pill and card elements - should be cards only
- Images and headers need size reduction
- Typography is too bold/large (over-typography issue)

**d/ Services Carousel Issues:**
- Moving too fast
- Need slow movement with pause on hover
- Resume movement when mouse leaves
- Add scroll feature as alternative

**e/ Unnecessary Sections:**
- "Advanced Features Demo" section - remove completely
- "Why Choose TechFlow Solutions?" section - remove completely

**f/ Footer Issues:**
- Text visibility poor
- Need background gradient for better readability
